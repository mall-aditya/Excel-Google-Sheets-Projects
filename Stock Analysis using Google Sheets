#Here I used Google Fiannce to get stock data and manupilated it in various ways to get some valuable information on stocks. 

Most of the markers here can be easily found of Yahoo Finance, therefore, it was a good way to check by work. 

The sheet is set to auto update every minute but the lag in Google Finance updating causes the numbers to be off from real-time observed values.

The pie-chart of portfolio diversity also dynamically changes at stocks are added or removed from the sheet.
